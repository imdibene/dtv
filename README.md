# Development Tools Visualisers

This repository holds a small collection of tools that provide a graphical form of visualisation for different parts of your POSIX/POSIX-like system (currently only tested on MacOS and Linux).

## How to build the collection of tools

First you need to *build* the build system:

```shell
clang -o nob nob.c
```

and then use it to build the applications:

```shell
./nob
```

This will create the `build` directory where all the built artifacts are located. Now you can use them.

## dtv: Device Tree Visualiser

This small cli tool generates a graphical representation of a *device-tree-blob*. If you are like me, and have a monkey brain and need to see the pretty pictures to\
understand all those fancy words, this tool might help you to understand the relationships of the devices of your platform.


```shell
./dtv foo.dtb <render_engine: dot|fdp>

./dtv foo.dtb fdp
./dtv foo.dtb dot
```

This will create a `foo.svg` as output, now your device tree has a graphical representation.

### tl;dr

foo.dtb -> [ dtv : dot|fdp ] -> foo.svg

## ps2gv: Process Tree to Graph Visualiser

This cli tool is inspired by Brendan Gregg's [Colony Graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/colonygraphs.html) scripts, this capture a snapshop of your system processes and their parent and child relationships.

the cli tool supports these usage patterns:

- Read from `ps`, `fdp` render to `process_tree.svg` file per default:

```shell
./ps2gv
```

- Read from `ps`, output `DOT` to `stdout`:

```shell
./ps2gv -o -
```

- Read from `ps`, output `DOT` to custom SVG file:

```shell
./ps2gv -o foobar.svg
```

- Read from file, `fdp` render to `process_tree.svg` output file:

```shell
./ps2gv -i processes.txt
```

- Read from file, output `DOT` to `stdout`:

```shell
./ps2gv -i processes.txt -o -
```

- Read from file, `fdp` render to custom SVG file:

```shell
./ps2gv -i processes.txt -o foobar.svg
```

The input file can be generated:

- for Linux

```shell
ps -eo zone,ppid,pid,rss,pcpu,comm
```

- for MacOS

```shell
ps -eo ppid,pid,rss,pcpu,comm
```
